# DysarthriaEmoEnhancer

Dysarthria is a speech disorder that can make it challenging for individuals to articulate their thoughts and emotions effectively, often leading to misinterpretations by others. The goal of this project is the development of a tool which, by leveraging Automatic Speech Recognition and sentiment analysis techniques is able to analyze the sentiment and emotional tone of their spoken words, to help them build confidence and adapt their communication style according to how their speech could be perceived by others.
